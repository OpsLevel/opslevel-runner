### Feature
* Adding leader election to handle scaling
* Add scaling capability
### Refactor
* Log error message when Sentry isn't configured
* Split log processor so we can handle stdout differently then stderr
* add `--job-pod-max-lifetime` flag with a default of 3600 seconds (1hr) to limit job pod lifetime
* rename all `pod-*` flags to `job-pod-*` to clarify what they effect now that the runner also self-scales
* rename all `POD_*` env vars to `JOB_POD_*` to sync to the changes made to the flags
### Bugfix
* Fixes a problem where stderr lines sometimes end up in multiline outcome vars inadvertantly
